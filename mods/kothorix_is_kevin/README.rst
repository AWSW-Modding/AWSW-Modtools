Information
===========
This mod replaces the met Kevin scene with a scene where you met Kothorix.
The creation of this mod was approved by Kothorix before starting.
We agreed with Kothorix as to what his character would be like, other than that Kothorix gave us total control over the mod.

Description of Kothorix character:

In his head he's as sexy as a young Sharon Stone and as popular as Michael Jackson but in actuality he's more like Margo Martindale. People who recognise him have an "Oh OK then" response at best.

Conflicts
=========

The byekevin mod will not work with this mod.

Old saves will not work due to new variables required by the mod. Make a new game to initialize them.

Notes from Maker
================

Hello guys,
This mod was never meant to turn out this big. It began as a way to get me started with modding AWSW and with Ren'Py in preparation for a bigger mod.
At no point did I know what direction to take this mod nor did I have any plan. The direction the mod took occurred on it's own.
I asked the beta testers for idea's every now and then but they were in the same boat as me "What do I do with a character I don't know?" More often than not the suggestion I got was to include content from the videos which is something I wanted to avoid.

I worked on this mod whenever I got stressed over something and working on this mod help me get through some tougher times when dealing with things. It kinda came across in the mod if you look at it objectively, the emotional tone is a little all over the place.
Alot of time and effort went into making this mod a reality. I hope you guys can forgive the bad writing and just have a bit of fun and a laugh with it.

I'd like to thank a few people now.
The beta testers (DragonMalte, Cryoraptor and Meowers!) for helping out with debugging the mod. They volunteered their free time to help me out and I appreciate that.
Cryoraptor. He was there since the start of the mod development and pushed me to make the mod bigger. It gave me a lot of work to do but I hope it made the mod more fun. He suggested quite a few idea's here and there when he could.
Meowers! He began involvement as a Beta tester and then offered to become an editor. He corrected most of the dialogue, either by complete rewording or correcting my terrible grammar. In short; he English's good.

The mod has a secret or two in there and I look forward to seeing if someone will figure it out.
I'd appreciate any feedback you might have, it'll help me improve for work on the next mod.

Have fun and enjoy.
